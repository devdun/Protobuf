# ExBanking Service

## Overview
ExBanking Service is a banking microservice that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as user creation, depositing money, and retrieving balances. It includes a test suite for validating these core functionalities.

## Features
- **User Creation**: Creates a new user in the system.
- **Deposit Money**: Deposits money into a user's account, updating their balance.
- **Get Balance**: Retrieves the current balance for a specific user.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (>=12.x.x)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Install Dependencies
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration
The project uses TypeScript and Jest for testing. Ensure TypeScript is configured correctly with the settings defined in `tsconfig.json`.

### Key Configuration Files
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration
- **`jest.config.js`**: Jest testing configuration

## Usage

### Running Tests
To execute the test suite, use:
- npm run build
- npm start
- npm test
```
This will run all the test cases located in the `test` directory.

### Test Structure
The test suite includes test cases for:
- **Creating a User**: Verifies user creation functionality.
- **Depositing Money**: Checks if money can be deposited successfully.
- **Retrieving Balance**: Ensures balance retrieval functionality works as expected.

### Key Dependencies
- **`@grpc/grpc-js`**: gRPC for server-client communication.
- **`@types/jest`** and **`jest`**: Testing framework and types.
- **`ts-jest`**: TypeScript preprocessor for Jest.
- **`sinon`**: Used for stubbing and mocking functions.

## Project Structure
```
/src                # Source code for the banking service
/test               # Test cases for banking service functionality
dist/               # Compiled JavaScript files
package.json        # Project dependencies and scripts
tsconfig.json       # TypeScript configuration
jest.config.js      # Jest configuration for testing
```

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly with `npm install`.
- If TypeScript errors occur, check the `tsconfig.json` file for configuration issues.
- For gRPC-related issues, ensure the correct version of `@grpc/grpc-js` is installed.
